<h2> Fun Facts About Me! </h2>
<p> I love animals of all sizes. Growing up, I was always charmed by the cute black cat in my neighbourhood. I remember purposely walking to the void deck of the block opposite mine to "hunt down" the cat, and then spend the next 15 minutes or so petting and playing with the cat. Despite cats being one of my favourite animals, I do own a pet dog, and I love him dearly as well!</p>
  <br>
<p> I have an older brother, Eugene, who graduated just last year in 2017. </p>
<p> In my free time, when I am not studying, I love to draw! Drawings helps me keep my mind of academic stress, and keeps me relaxed. </p>

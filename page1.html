<h1> My Achievements </h1>
<p> I have represented my primary school, Park View Primary School, in various competitions, such as the International Science Drama Competition in collaboration with the Singapore Science Centre, and the Debate Wits and Words. I have completed up to 76.5hours of training in my CCA, drama, and have had the honour to be in my school's very own debate team. </;>
<h1> My CCA </h1>
<p> In Dunman High, my new CCA is Volleyball! I never would have guessed that I would join a sports CCA, but here I am! Although I have little to no experience in the sport, only having two to four brief lessons on Volleyball as part of my Physical Education module back in primary school, I enjoy the presence and support of my new teammates, and I am ever grateful for their coaching and advice. >/p> </p>

</ul>

<p>I also enjoy spending quality time with my family and friends, and I love going to Pasir Ris Park for a walk under the breezy weather. However, I also enjoy studying and going to the libary as I like the peace and quiet.</p>
